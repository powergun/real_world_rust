# Rust Functional Programming

FP in Rust book.

## Project Structure

L657

group definitions like this may be helpful to standardize file
layout and improve readability:

trait definitions

data structure and trait implementations

functions

main

## Functional Design Patterns

L683

> A function defines a transformation, accepts data, and returns
> the result of the transformation. A functor defines data, accepts
> a function, and returns the result of the transformation.

## Functor and Monad

see `functors` and `monads` sub projects

NOTE: implementing idiomatic functor and monad is not practical;
but the knowledge of them helps to write good rust code
